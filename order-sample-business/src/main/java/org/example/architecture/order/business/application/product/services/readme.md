# Services

These are the implementations of the input uses cases and it role is to orchestrate the domain uses and different rules and interactions. 

You can create a Write Use cases Service like the Read but we presume that the creation process is not simple and we need to create a class for it.
So this is the rule, if it's simple you can combine some uses cases or rules otherwise respect the SRP principle
